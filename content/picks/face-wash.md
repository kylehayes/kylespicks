# Reducing single-use plastic

These days Iâ€™m trying to be mindful of the products that I have to buy repeatedly that are made from single-use plastic. Soaps used for bathing are major offenders as their lifespan may be only a couple of months. Then Iâ€™m at the store buying another plastic bottle that I drop into the recycling bin when its emptyâ€”which is fine, because they get recycled, right? The big lie of recycling is not the focus of this post and I hope to write a more extensive one at another time. For the time being [check out this report](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/us-recycling-plastic-waste) as an introduction to the misleading idea that the plastic we are putting into the recycling bin is probably being sent to the landfill.

# Zero waste

Iâ€™ve become more familiar with the term (and movement) _zero waste_ recently. Further, Iâ€™ve found that there are both brick and mortar and online stores that sell common essentials in packaging that is not single-use plastic.

My pick for face wash comes from [TheGoodFill.co](https://a.marsello.com/l/6296f2b9008cdc137ca6ed56) who Iâ€™ve recently discovered and have really been extremely happy with their offerings. Buyers can visit their store in person where they can take in their reusable containers (say a mason jar you have lying around) and fill them up straight from the bulk containers. Given these stores are in Nashville, Tennessee and Iâ€™m in Los Angeles, Iâ€™m not able to visit in person. For people like me, their shipping program is the best Iâ€™ve seen compared to other options.

From several of their product pages, buyers can choose the buy the product in a reusable containerâ€”such as glass, aluminum, or multi-use plasticâ€”or if they already have a container, they can buy just the refill of the product. If it is liquid, it is shipped in a multi-use lightweight plastic pouch that you empty into your container when you receive it, then mail the pouch back in a prepaid envelope back to the TheGoodFill. They clean and sanitize the pouches for reuse on future shipments as many times as the pouch can handle. For dry products like oxy powder or dishwashing soap, they ship it in a recyclable brown paper bag.

# The Pick

All of this is great but doesnâ€™t really help if the face wash is no good, right? Iâ€™ve been using their face wash for well over a month now and am extremely happy with it. The citrus scent is refreshing to inhale in the morning when I take my showers. Some face washes are so thin they are hard to create a nice lather on your skin but this one is well balanced between being thicker but not so thick it is difficult to spread or rinse off. Further, my skin seems to be sufficiently hydrated and definitely have not noticed any adverse dryness caused by the product.

If you find yourself shopping at TheGoodFill because of all their other wonderful products, this face wash is an easy sell and a strong recommended pick from me.
