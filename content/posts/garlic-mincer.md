Our household loves garlic. We especially love cooking with it. You know what we don't love? Chopping a bunch of it with a knife. We aren't professional chefs and so not only is this process tedious but its sticky and imprints the garlic scent on your hand longer than is welcome. I've tried several kitchen tools for chopping garlic but this one has lasted the longest.

One of the big benefits of this tool is it has no sharp metal blades to avoid, or complicated mechanisms to scrape garlic pieces or juice out of. The NexTrend Garlic Twister is made in the USA of a high-grade polycarbonate plastic. The simplicity of this device is also a great strength. It easily chops a few garlic gloves but if you put too many in, you need to press gently and twist a few times to get it going. It can chop other things too like nuts, ginger, and chili peppers, but I've not tried those.

Cleanup is also easy as I simply put in the top rack of our dishwasher without a problem. I don't buy a lot of kitchen gadgets especially single-use ones but this one is a must for me and a highly recommended pick for your kitchen arsenal.
