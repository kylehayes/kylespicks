Epicurean cutting boards are the epitome of simple, functional, and reasonably priced kitchen tools that you will likely enjoy using on a daily basis. I use a cutting board nearly every day and usually more than once. I'm preparing and cutting kid's sandwiches for lunch, slicing fruit, chopping tomatoes or onions, or slicing BBQ ribs. I need it to work with me during these times and be easy to clean up in a busy household.

We've gone through dozen's of cutting boards in the years we've been married. Wood, bamboo, and plastic/nylon cutting boards are widely available in most stores that sell home goods. They all have their pros and cons. Bamboo is nice to cut on but its a bit more effort to keep in good shape and definitely cannot go into the dishwasher. Low quality wood cutting boards really aren't safe to cut on because they can absorb and retain bacteria. Plastic is cheap, easy to cut on, dishwasher safe, but it will dull your knife faster and also gives you the added bonus of [putting micro plastics into your food](https://fifthandcherry.com/blogs/news/youre-eating-more-plastic-than-you-think).

Epicurean cutting boards are my latest and seemingly last choice. I've been using these boards for over two years and see no reason to choose anything else. Plastic cutting boards are what we relied on heavily before in recent years because they were widely available as an inexpensive multi-pack from Costco. However, it didn't take long for the knife to cut deep grooves—which I now know also puts tiny pieces in the food—but they would actually stain quite easily even when putting in the dishwasher. The Epicurean cutting boards don't have any of these problems. The surface is still nearly as smooth as they were the day I bought them (I bought a two pack, one large, one medium). They are lightweight, fit nicely in the dishwasher, hand clean very easily, made 100% in the USA, and are made out of a paper-composite material called [Richlite](https://www.richlite.com). The history of Epicurean is pretty interesting as they originally made city skate parks with ramps out of this material. They would make cutting boards and other kitchen utensils for friends and family out of the leftover scraps of the material which became so popular that the founders pivoted and started focusing solely on kitchen tools. You can [read and watch more of their history](https://www.epicureancs.com/about/) on their website.

I relish in the moments when I realize I've found a product that is simple, meets my functional needs, leans into my ecological standards, is easy to maintain, and is actually affordable. Certainly with anything I purchase, I hope to meet all these standards but its rare to hit on all of them.

Note: I own a few other pieces of Epicurean's products that I will provide links to as well in future posts.
