# Kyle's Picks

People often ask for my opinion on what to buy in a variety of product categories. The reason for this is tends to be because of the amount of research I do on larger purchases and my pedantic desire to have the right product for my needs. Iâ€™m known from time to time to buy things and return them when they donâ€™t work out, but never in a dishonest way or against the intent of a storeâ€™s return policy.

Iâ€™m going to start managing this list of things I approve of and will try to write notes when possible.
